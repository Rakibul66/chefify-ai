# Recipe Finder

Recipe Finder is an iOS app built with SwiftUI that allows users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have. The app fetches images related to the search results and displays them in a grid layout. Users can click on any image to view the recipe's source.

## Features

- **Search for Recipes**: Enter ingredients, and the app fetches recipes that match.
- **Grid of Images**: Displays recipe images in a grid layout.
- **Click to Open Recipe Source**: Clicking on an image will open the recipe's source in a web browser.

## Screenshots

Here are three images of the app interface showing the grid layout of recipe images:
